**Shardcake** is a **Scala open source library** that makes it easy to distribute entities across multiple servers and interact with those entities using their ID without knowing their actual location (this is also known as *location transparency*). 

Shardcake exposes a **purely functional API** and depends heavily on [ZIO](https://zio.dev).

The [Documentation](https://devsisters.github.io/shardcake/) explains how to use Shardcake, in particular:
- how to [get started](https://devsisters.github.io/shardcake/docs/)
- the [architecture](https://devsisters.github.io/shardcake/docs/architecture.html) behind Shardcake
- how to [configure](https://devsisters.github.io/shardcake/docs/config.html) it
- parts you can [customize](https://devsisters.github.io/shardcake/docs/customization.html)
